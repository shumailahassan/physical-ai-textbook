# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This course teaches how AI extends beyond digital systems into the physical world. You will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is organized into five interconnected modules that build upon each other to provide you with a complete understanding of modern humanoid robot systems:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS2)
- **Communication & Coordination**: Learn the ROS2 framework that serves as the nervous system for robots
- **Architecture**: Understand nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Message Passing**: Master the communication patterns that connect robot components

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Simulation Environments**: Create virtual worlds for robot testing and development
- **Robot Modeling**: Build accurate physics models of your robots
- **Virtual Testing**: Validate systems in safe, controlled environments before deployment

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- **Perception Systems**: Enable robots to understand their environment
- **Control Systems**: Implement sophisticated movement and manipulation
- **Decision Making**: Create intelligent behaviors and responses

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
- **Multimodal Perception**: Integrate vision, language, and action understanding
- **Language Understanding**: Enable natural human-robot interaction
- **Action Planning**: Execute complex tasks through multimodal understanding

### Module 5: Complete Humanoid Robot Integration
- **System Integration**: Bring all modules together into a cohesive system
- **Validation & Testing**: Ensure all components work harmoniously
- **Real-World Deployment**: Deploy complete humanoid robots in practical applications

## Learning Path

Each module contains:
- **Theoretical Concepts**: Understanding the principles behind the technology
- **Practical Implementation**: Hands-on exercises and examples
- **Integration Points**: Connections to other modules showing how systems work together
- **Exercises**: Practice problems to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python/C++)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Interest in robotics and AI

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the communication foundation, then progress through each module sequentially, or use the [Navigation Guide](./navigation-guide.md) to follow a path tailored to your background and interests.

This textbook follows a spec-driven development approach, ensuring each component is well-defined before implementation. By completing this textbook, you will be able to design and implement complete humanoid robot systems that integrate perception, control, and decision-making capabilities.
