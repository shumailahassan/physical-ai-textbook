# Tutorial Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This textbook is organized into five interconnected modules that build upon each other to provide you with a complete understanding of modern humanoid robot systems.

## Overview

This textbook covers:
- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS2) - Communication and coordination framework
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Simulation and virtual testing environments
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - AI perception, control, and decision-making
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems - Multimodal integration for advanced capabilities
- **Module 5**: Complete Humanoid Robot Integration - Bringing all modules together

## Getting Started
